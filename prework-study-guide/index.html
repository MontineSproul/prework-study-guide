            <li>The head element contains information about the webpage. </li>
            <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user. </li>
            <li>The paragraph element will contain most of the text for a webpage. </li>
            <li>For an image tag it must contain a src attribute, this will be where the image is stored.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>It is best practice to add an alt attribute as well. This is useful if the image does not load or an assistant is being used. The alt attribute is a description of the picture.</li>
                <li>The image tage is a self closing tag which means it uses only one tag for the element.</li>
              </ul>
            <li>There are six different heading elements h1, h2, h3, h4, h5 and h6. h1 should only be used once per page.</li>
            <li>There are two different types of list elements, an unordered list and an ordered list. Each of these elements will have the child element of li.</li>

            <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
            <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside of an element.</li>
