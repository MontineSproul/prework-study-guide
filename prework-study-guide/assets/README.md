# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
A place where bootcamp students can go to review what they have learned during the prework. This assignment was built to impliment all of the cool new things we are learning and to keep track of key points by having all of the notes in the right place. I learned how to search for a bug and how to put to work what I am learning so far. Save often. Test often.

Each section of this webpage contains notes on the different topics such as HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript. If we open the DevTools console, we can see the HavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first.
